# STATE

This file tracks large, "hot topics" that are ongoing. It may not be active all the time.


## State management rules

  + The current target system should remain stable during a draft unless a human changes the problem statement or scope.
  + The status can be set to `DONE` only when the human reviewer has explicitly approved the result
  + Keep this file focused on current execution state. Put rollups and resolved items in `history.md`.

## Current focus

  **Revision ID:** Arch.0.1

  **Status:** NOT_STARTED  <!-- one of: NOT_STARTED | IN_PROGRESS | IN_REVIEW | DONE | FREEZE -->

## Objective (current draft)
<!-- 1 sentence. Keep aligned with `.architecture/architecture_description.md`. -->

## Active assumptions / constraints

<!-- Keep only the assumptions or constraints that materially affect the current architecture draft. -->

  + [assumption or constraint]

## Work log (current session)

<!-- Append-only bullets for what changed and why. Prefer file/section references. -->

  + **YYYY-MM-DD:** [change made and reason]

## Workflow state

  + [ ] PROBLEM_CLARIFIED
  + [ ] DRAFT_CREATED
  + [ ] HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED
  + [ ] DECISIONS_CAPTURED

## Key Architecture Decisions

<!-- Populated at FREEZE. Summarize the major orientations chosen during the architecture review.
     This section is the primary reference for downstream agents (component, vibe).
     Use concise bullet points. Examples: cloud provider, core patterns, technology families, key constraints. -->

  + [decision]

## Active issues

<!-- Keep only active issues here. Move resolved items to history.md. -->

  + [ ] **Arch.0.1:** [short title]
