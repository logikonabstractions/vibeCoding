# STATE

## State management rules

  + The "Current Focus" can ONLY be updated once the previous checkpoint's STATUS is marked "DONE"
  + A status can be set to DONE **only** in 2 cases: once all acceptance points have been met, OR clear explicit permission from a human has been granted to consider the checkpoint done.
